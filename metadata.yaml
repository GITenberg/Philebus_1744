description: In The Tragedy and Comedy of Life, Seth Benardete focuses on the idea
  of the good in what is widely regarded as one of Plato's most challenging and complex
  dialogues, the Philebus. Traditionally the Philebus is interpreted as affirming
  the doctrine that the good resides in thought and mind rather than in pleasure or
  the body. Benardete challenges this view, arguing that Socrates vindicates the life
  of the mind over against the life of pleasure not by separating the two and advocating
  a strict asceticism, but by mixing pleasure and pain with mind in such a way that
  the philosophic life emerges as the only possible human life. Benardete combines
  a probing and challenging commentary that subtly mirrors and illumines the complexities
  of this dialogue with the finest English translation of the Philebus yet available.
  The result is a work that will be of great value to classicists, philosophers, and
  political theorists alike.
